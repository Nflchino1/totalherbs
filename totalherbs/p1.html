    <h3>

         The Himalayan Crystal Lamp 
        becomes warm and attracts water molecules 
        from the air. The salt particles bind with 
        the water molecules, which are then evaporated 
        into the atmosphere of a room. As the salt is 
        primarily negatively charged the ions emitted are
         slightly negative. This helps to neutralise the excess 
         positive ions in our living spaces that are present due
          to electrical goods and positively charged dust particles.
           The physical body responds to ionisation, as it prefers a
            neutral balance of ions with a small surplus of negative ions. 
            It is also important to note that due to the transformation
             cycle of hydrogen and oxygen, as well as Sodium and Chloride ions the
         surrounding air becomes measurably cleaner. This is of great
          help to allergy and asthma sufferers.

<h1> DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CRYSTAL SALT AND COMMON TABLE SALT üëáüèæ </h1>

<br>

<div class="salty">

   <h3>
    1. Table salt consists of just sodium, chloride and has nothing to do with real, natural, holistic salt <br>
    2. Table Salt is a dangerous cellular poison that the body eliminates or stores with an immense energy and effort. <br>
    3. Natural salt is crucial for maintaining vital body functions of which the body is made of. <br>
    4. Crystal salts contain all the minerals and trace elements of which the body is made of. <br>

   <h1> NATURE'S SALT CELLAR üëáüèæ </h1></div>
<br>
   <div class="salty">
    <h3>The Earth has plentiful resources of salt, not only in the oceans, but also in the form of rocks. In contrast to sea salt, the salt in rock, hidden in the belly of the Earth, was protected to a large extent from environmental inuences.
    The decisive factor in the formation of pure, natural crystal salt is the pressure to which the salt was subjected for millions of years. Crystal salts from the Himalayas are today considered to be the highest quality grade salts, because of the enormous pressure forces during their creation. The typical composition of the Himalayan salt is made up of 84 different minerals.
    Totalherbs Himalayan crystal salt has been ethically sourced to bring the highest grade of salt to your able.
    Totalherbs Himalayan crystal salt is also approved by the Organic Farmers & Growers as an ingredient for use in organic processing and can be used as a natural alternative to processed Sodium Chloride (common table salt).
